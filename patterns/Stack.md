# Stack

## Definition

One-ended linear data structure modeling a real-world stack.

LIFO: Last In, First Out.

Two operations: "push" and "pop"

(analogous to add and remove.)

Only access to the top of the stack via a pointer.

Supports recursion through tracking previous function calls

DFS uses a Stack for implementation.

## Complexity Analysis (given LinkedList implementation)

Push    O(1)

Pop     O(1)

Peek    O(n)

Search  O(n)

Size    O(1)
